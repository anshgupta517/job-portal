## Features

*   **Basic HTML Structure:** The project utilizes HTML as its primary language, indicating a focus on web page structure and content.
*   **Potential Django Integration:** The presence of `manage.py` and a `JobPortal` directory hints at the possible use of the Django framework for backend functionality.
