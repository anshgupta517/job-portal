# Job Portal - Django

## Overview

This project, written primarily in HTML, aims to provide a platform for job seekers and employers to connect. While a detailed description is currently unavailable, the project structure suggests a web-based application.

## Features


*   Implemented user authentication and role-based access control for Applicants, Companies, and Administrators.
*   Enabled companies to post, edit, and manage job listings, including details like salary, experience, and location.
*   Allowed applicants to create profiles, browse available jobs, view job details, and apply with resume uploads.
*   Built an administrative backend for user management and company verification (accept/reject registrations).
*   Utilized Django's ORM for database interactions and managed user data, job postings, and applications effectively.
